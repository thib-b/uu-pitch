## What is git

#HSLIDE
# Distributed Version Control
* Version Control System
* Distributed - every copy of the codebase is a complete repository

#HSLIDE
## History
* Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds after Bitkeeper agreement ended.
* Criterias for creation
    - patching time < 3s
    - Take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision
    - Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow
    - Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious

* Use git - this slideshow. etc.
