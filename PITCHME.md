## What is git

#HSLIDE
## Distributed Version Control
* Version Control System
* Distributed - every copy of the codebase is a complete repository

#HSLIDE
## History
* Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds after Bitkeeper agreement ended.
* Criterias for creation
    - patching time < 3s
    - Take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision
    - Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow
    - Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious

#HSLIDE
From the [official readme](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290/README) :
```
The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"
and the name as (depending on your way):

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you''re in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
 - "g*dd*mn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks
```
